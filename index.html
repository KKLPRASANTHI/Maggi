		Maggi is my second love. First love is also Maggi😝. I still have reminiscence about those good old days when I used to hanker while the tasty Maggi is being cooked by M😍M. Its because of maggi that I have learnt to cook.I used to drive my mom nuts with my insane obsession towards maggi.</p>

		Its a great evening when it comes to eating yippee. I love cooking Yippie when I am lethargic and dont know what to do with my life. This kind of rejuvenates my mind and gives my mind a good start. Basically the impact of Yippie on me is akin to what is coffee to many others</p>
